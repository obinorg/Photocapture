For more info look into README.txt

Located on launchpad at

Working example at
http://fabryka.obin.org/tutturu/

Installation of “photocapture”:
In below example is covered installation on remote locations with central server and storage.
It might be easily tuned for ordinary single linux desktop installation.


1.What you need:
- Digital photo camera with power adapter capable of being controlled from linux: most canon
cameras can do the job.
- One PC for server and/or one for remote capturing. You don't need new machines for it,
5 years old pc is ok, difference is only in time it takes to generate a movie.
P4 with 1GB of ram is able to compress photos from 2 cameras every minute, generate movie every
30 minutes and send website to thousands web visitors every day.

2.Install “Ubuntu server 8.04” on the server and clients.
Download: http://releases.ubuntu.com/hardy/
Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/index.html

3.On every remote client :
- connect camera
- install gphoto2: sudo apt-get install gphoto2
- test camera capability by taking test photo from linux command line.

gphoto2 --capture-image

More on gphoto2 subject is here:
http://www.gphoto.org/doc/manual/using-gphoto2.html
http://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/126189-schedule-photo-taking-with-gphoto-and-cron

If you are not able to make photos with gphoto2, tray the alternative package
called “capture” from: http://capture.sourceforge.net/.
If you have problems with compiling it, you may tray  with package from
http://fabryka.obin.org/tutturu/sites/default/files/Capture-bin.tar.gz  - its
compiled by Przemysław Kalicki <p.kalicki@gmail.com>.  
Some times you might experience strange problems with camera and reset feature will not work.
Use a script called /close-camera.sh to close it every given time.

4. Download and extract scripts into a home dir of default user. You
should have ~/photocapture/make-photo-cron.sh

5. Tune scripts for your needs: dirs and time patterns.
- change all references to /home/user/ to your paths.
- ~/dump is directory where photos are coming in from camera and remote machine.
- ~/image-input/ is directory where images are coped after processing

6. Generate ssh key pair and add it to master server.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys
Make a test run and check if file appears on server. When all is working fine, make logfile:
touch /home/user/photocapture/make-photo-cron.log
- Set the crontab, one below will run every one minute from 6 to 21:
*/1 6-21 * * * /home/user/photocapture/make-photo-cron.sh > /home/user/photocapture/make-photo-cron.log 2>&1

By now your clinet should make photos and send them to central server.

7. On server side: if photos are coming, time to make a show out of it:
- Get the photocapture scripts and unpack it to home dir.
- Install medibuntu repository http://www.medibuntu.org/ - its for proper ffmpeg
- Install apache webserver, mencoder (for movies out of photos), ffmpeg (for flv), ffmpeg2theora (for ogv movies) and image magic for photo conversion (convert command):
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg mencoder ffmpeg2theora imagemagic apache2
- tune scripts with your dirs and settings.
If all is working fine, put scripts into cron and watch effects in http://your-web-server/webcam/
